# A-Star Visualizer/Demonstration Tool
Visualization project built in HTML, CSS, and javascript made to help people better learn and understand the A* algorithm and it's benefits.
This site can be visited on my [portfolio site](https://aidanmara.info/astar-demo/).

note: currently mobile is slightly bugged, if you use it run it in landscape and avoid expanding the adjacency matrix.

## About the A-Star Visualizer

The project visualizes the A-Star algorithm's journey to find the shortest distance on a weighted graph of cities around the continental United States.

Starting and ending destinations can be selected using the UI at the bottom of the screen or by clicking on the appropriate marker on the map.

The program will visualize either the A-star algorithm or Dijkstra's, which can be switched using the button at the bottom of the screen.

Once the visualizer is started, the program will display the journey of the algorithm on the map and within the adjacency matrix located at the bottom left of the screen.
